Sure, I can explain how you can solve this problem in Java, step by step. We will use a common approach called backtracking to generate all possible permutations of a given list of numbers. Here's how you can do it:

Understand the Problem: You need to generate all permutations of a given list of distinct numbers. A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a specific order.
Steps to Approach
Initialization:

Start with a list of numbers (nums).
Initialize an empty list (result) to store all permutations.
Use a helper function that will be called recursively to generate the permutations.
Backtracking:

Backtracking involves recursively building permutations by adding one element at a time and removing it once all possibilities for that element are exhausted.
Implementation:

Use a helper method that takes the current list, the result list, and tracks the indices of elements being used.
For each call, add the current element, move on to the next level, and then backtrack to remove the element after all possibilities are explored.
Java Code for the Solution:
Here is the Java implementation of the solution:


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Permutations {
    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>(); // To store the result
        List<Integer> current = new ArrayList<>(); // To track current permutation
        boolean[] used = new boolean[nums.length]; // To track which elements are used

        backtrack(nums, current, result, used);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(int[] nums, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result, boolean[] used) {
        // Base case: If the current list has the same length as nums, a full permutation is formed
        if (current.size() == nums.length) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current)); // Add a copy of the current list to result
            return;
        }

        // Recursively add elements that are not yet used
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (used[i]) continue; // Skip already used elements

            current.add(nums[i]); // Choose the element
            used[i] = true; // Mark as used

            // Recursively call backtrack to explore more options
            backtrack(nums, current, result, used);

            // Backtrack: Undo the choice to explore other possibilities
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }

    // Test the implementation
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Permutations permutations = new Permutations();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3};
        int[] nums2 = {0, 1};

        System.out.println("Permutations of [1, 2, 3]: " + permutations.permute(nums1));
        System.out.println("Permutations of [0, 1]: " + permutations.permute(nums2));
    }
}
Step-by-Step Explanation:
Initial Setup:

Create an instance of List<List<Integer>> result to store the final list of permutations.
Create a List<Integer> current to keep track of the elements of the current permutation.
Create a boolean[] used array to track which elements have been used in the current permutation.
Backtrack Function:

The backtrack method is called with the input array, current list, result list, and the used boolean array.
Base Case: If the current list has the same length as the input array (nums), it means we have a valid permutation, so we add it to the result.
Recursive Step:
Loop through all elements of the nums array.
If an element is not used (used[i] == false), add it to the current list and mark it as used (used[i] = true).
Recursively call backtrack to continue building the permutation.
After finishing all recursive calls involving the current element, backtrack by removing the element (current.remove(current.size() - 1)) and marking it as unused (used[i] = false).
Time Complexity:

The time complexity for generating all permutations of a list of length n is O(n * n!).
n! permutations are generated, and for each permutation, you have to make a full copy of the list, resulting in n * n! total operations.
Example Walkthrough:
Consider nums = [1, 2, 3]:

Initially, current is empty, and used = [false, false, false].
You start by adding 1:
Current: [1], Used: [true, false, false]
Add 2:
Current: [1, 2], Used: [true, true, false]
Add 3:
Current: [1, 2, 3], Used: [true, true, true]
This is a complete permutation, add it to result.
Backtrack: Remove 3, mark 3 as unused.
Backtrack: Remove 2, mark 2 as unused.
Then add 3, and repeat.
This process continues until all possible arrangements are explored.

Output:
The output for the given examples would be:

nums = [1, 2, 3]: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
nums = [0, 1]: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
This approach ensures that every possible ordering is generated without duplication, and is well-suited for permutations problems in general.
